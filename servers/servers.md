# Open Api Specification 

## Servers Object

In the servers object you specify the basepath of your target server.

- You can also incorporate variables into the server URL that can be populated at runtime by your server. 
- If different paths (endpoints) require different server URLs, you can add the servers object as a property in the path objectâ€™s operation object. The locally declared servers URL will override the global servers URL.
